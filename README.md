## Claim List for FTB Chunks
#### Minecraft 1.21.1 Neoforge
Mod that adds copying a list of claims, claim coordinates, claim list, teleporting dirrectly to claims, and client side history.
</br >-Downsides currently include lack of extended configurability.
</br >-Currently the "Select server" button only shows history not actual claims. The caches are csv format, easy to read.
</br >-Claims grouped by 5 chunks apart in claim list, in history they need to be diagonal/next to eachother.
</br >-Made sure not to send packets when not needed, it hooks into FTB Chunks so it only request packets on a possible packet loss.
</br >-100% client side
</br >-Made with Claude ai
